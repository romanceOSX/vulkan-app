# 🐦‍🔥 Vulkan Sample app

The main objective of this project is to learn Vulkan and arrive to a 
general-purpose boilerplate project in a platform independent way

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are being consumed in this project
- Window surface independent library - [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)
- Linear algebra library - [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)

## Building the project

Call the entry [build](build.sh) script to build, for non-UNIX platforms, build
directly through CMake

## Triangle application

The triangle application is an easy way to proove that your system fully supports
vulkan and it is ready to use it in more complete projects/applications

Currently this is the main and only project, more complete example applications will be added in the future
