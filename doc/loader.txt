Vulkan loaders often have a bunch of symbols available in case one compiles
statically, yet this approach is not often desired, the normal workflow is to
compile dynamically against the loader and manually query the vulkan function
pointers to the desired logic

Types of linking:
    - Dynamically link to a shared library (.lib, .dylib, .so)
    - Static linking to a static library (.a, .lib)
    - Runtime loading of a shared library (use-case specific)

Windows specific
    In windows '.lib' could either be a:
        - import library
        - static library

Doubts
    - Why doesn't vulkan include a dynamic library with those out-of-core references
      extensions already in place?
        Not all the extension functions are guaranteed to be available in all vulkan implementations
        In addition, the OS dll dynamic dispatch needs to guaranteed that all functions references exist
            This last point is only valid if we dynamically link to a shared library,
            we can also do this manually through some special functions at runtime, but that depends
            on the program, this concept of manual loading is heavily used in vulkan
