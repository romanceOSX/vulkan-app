Resources are views of memory with associated formatting and dimensionality

Buffers
    Usually binded to pipelines by the use of 'descriptors sets'

    Workflow:
        - We first declare the buffer view and what are we going to use it for,
          this does not allocate anything but it will give us more insight on the
          characteristics we need to allocate the actual device memory
        - Find the appropiate index that satisfy the resource's memory requirements
        - Allocate the device memory from the appropiate queue family? device type?
