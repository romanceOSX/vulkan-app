Resources are views of memory with associated formatting and dimensionality

Buffers
    Usually binded to pipelines by the use of 'descriptors sets'

    Workflow:
        - We first declare the buffer view and what are we going to use it for,
          this does not allocate anything but it will give us more insight on the
          characteristics we need to allocate the actual device memory
        - Find the appropiate index that satisfy the resource's memory requirements
        - Allocate the device memory from the appropiate queue family? device type?

Vulkan Memory
    When we query the memory requirements, it will tell us which memory types it supports
    This is done in the form of bits, the bit number 'i' will tell us that the heap 
    type number 'i' is supported

    So the rule is that whatever memory type we plan to use to allocate memory from
    must follow the following:
        memory_requirements.memoryTypeBits & (1 << i) != 0;
        memory_properties.memoryTypes[i].propertyFlags has the features we asked for

        The memory flags indicate the following
            - Device local
            - Host visible
