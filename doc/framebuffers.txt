Framebuffers
    --> https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/03_Drawing_a_triangle/03_Drawing/00_Framebuffers.html

    - framebuffer is expected to be the same as the swapchain's image format
    - the render pass bounds with a VkFramebuffer object, this in turn references
      image views objects
    - The VkFramebuffer object depends on the type of image retrieved from the
      swapchain, meaning that we have to create a framebuffer depending on the
      retreived image, we need to cover all cases
