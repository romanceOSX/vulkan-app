    Graphics pipelines include vertex shader execution as part of the 'primitive assembly'

    Shaders can read from input variables
    They can also output variables

    These variables can be used for communicating between shader stages
    Or to interact with variables that exists within the execution environment

    Shaders interact with an 'execution environment' (our application)

    We use built-in decorators to associate the execution environment provided inputs
    with the shader

    Describing these 'decorators' is the workload of vulkan's shader api
