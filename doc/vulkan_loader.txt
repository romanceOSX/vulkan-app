Dispatch tables and chain calls

A dispatchable handle in vulkan under the hood (In the loader) is a pointer
to a structure, that structure contains a pointer to a dispatch table that
containspointers to vulkan functions relating to that specific object

There are two types of tables that the loader mantains:
    - Instance dispatch table
        - created when calling vkCreateInstance
    - Device dispatch table
        - created when calling vkCreateDevice

When either of these functions are called, the loader will create a 'call chain'
for each of the functions

When calling a function normally the first thing it will hit is a trampoline function
that calls to the appropiate entry within the dispatch table for the given object

Call Chain
                    vulkan dispatchable handle
                            points to...
            structure with data and a pointer to a dispatch table
                            pointing to...
        dispatch table with function pointers pointing to the first
                        element of the call chain
