Host memory
    Memory needed by the vulkan implementation for non-device-visible storage
        - contents of the image
        - buffer objects

Query device memory properties
    VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties 

Usual workflow for buffers
    - create buffer and specify use
    - the result buffer structure will expose its requirements through a bitfield,
      these requirements tell us the compatible memory types
    - as a user we have the control to specify which memory properties we want, this is
      controled through VkMemoryPropertyFlags
    - we use these two pieces of information (compatible memory types + requested flags) to
      find the most appropiate memory type to allocate memory from
