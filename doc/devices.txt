Physical Device
    ...

Logical Device
    --> https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/devsandqueues.html#devsandqueues-devices
    At creation we specify:
        - devices extensions
        - created queues

Queue families
    These can be queried before the creation of a logical device, through the
    vulkan physical device construct

    Queue family index
        These tie together operations in multiple places within vulkan
        to specift family of queues
            - when retrieving a device queue
            - when creating a command pool
                (only command pools of the index from the created queue can be used)
            - when creating resources (buffers / images)

Queue creation
    Queue creation is coupled with the creation of a Logical Device

A device has 'n' number of queue families, each queue family has an 'x'
amount of queues for such given queue family
