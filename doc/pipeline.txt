    - Vertex Input
    - Input Assembly
    - Rasterizer
        Takes the geometry shaped by the vertices from the vertex shader and turns
        it into fragments to be colored by the fragment shader
        Also performs: 
            - depth testing
            - face culling
            - scissor test

What are pipeline states?
