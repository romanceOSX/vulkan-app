Command buffers
    --> https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/03_Drawing_a_triangle/03_Drawing/01_Command_buffers.html

    Commands in vulkan:
        - drawing operations
        - memory transfers
    they are not excecuted directly by doing function calls
    you have to record these operations in a command buffer
    the recording of these commands can be multithreaded, this is an advantage

command pool
    they manage the memory that is used to store the buffers
    command buffers are allocated from them

Recording commands
    Once we have a command buffer, we begin recording commands into it

    - begin recording
    - begin render pass
    - bind to pipeline
