Draw commands are recorded within a render pass
A render pass defines a set of image resources (attachments) to be used
during rendering


A render pass defines the types of inputs and outputs (slots)
A subpass defines what each of the slots is used for
A framebuffer provides the images into those slots

It is all indexed, if the subpass uses the attachment 0 of the render pass, then
the framebuffer gets mapped to its 0'th attachment to be used in the draw operations

Render pass compatibility
    So that means that the formats specified in the framebuffer's slots must match
    those present in the renderpass' attachments
