Render pass vs Pipeline

Render pass
    Defines the structure of rendering
    How the rendering will interact with framebuffers
    Rendering sesison
    It can be thought of as the 'rendering infrastructure'

    Defines the set of image resources

Render pipeline
    It uses the render pass (the infrastructure) to do the actual rendering
    It describes how something is rendered

Framebuffer
    A collection of image views and a set of dimensions
    In conjuction with a render pass, they define the inputs and outputs used
    by drawing commands

Render pass
    An object that represents a set of framebuffer attachments and phases of rendering
    using those targets


States
    These refer to the configuration settings that define how
        - rendering
        - computation
        - resource usage
    behave

    Pipeline states
        These define Fixed-function behaviour
    
    Static vs Dynamic states
        Static are set during the pipeline creation
        Dynamics are through commands
