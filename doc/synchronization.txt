/* image acquire */
We create fences and semaphores
Fences are created with the 'signaled' state triggered

Wait for 'in_flight' fence to be singaled (it is)

Aquire next image and fire the 'image_semaphore' when ready

Set the fence to unsignaled

/* command buffer submission */
record command buffer

wait for 'image_semaphore'
signal 'render semaphore' when done
signal 'in_flight' fence when done
submit info

/* present to surface */
wait for 'render semaphore' to be signaled


VkQueueSubmit
    once this operation finishes, it resets the signaled state of the waiting synchronization
    primitives
