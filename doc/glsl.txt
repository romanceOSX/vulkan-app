Vulkan shaders
    Vulkan understands a bytecode SPIR-V format
    Asking vendors to comply to a bytecode format is way easier than asking them to
    build a whole language specification
    Either way GLSL is normally used for this
GLSL
    Vulkan ships with a GLSL->SPIR-V compiler
    GLSL relies a lot in global variables
    It processes inputs and outputs as global variables
    vertex shader
        coorditanes look like this {x, y, z, w}
        when divided by w, it turns framebuffer coordinates into clip coordinates
        also known as homogeneus coordinates
        gl_VertexIndex is the global variable that holds the index of the current vertex
        gl_Position serves as an output variable for a point in clip coordinates
                    this is the default output variable
    fragment shader
