The swapchain represents a queue of images (framebuffers) that the GPU draws
into and then presents to the screen
Each of the images represents an available image that can be
    - rendered to
    - presented to the display

Normally systems have the following configurations:
    - double buffering
        one image is presented while the other one is being rendered to
    - triple buffering
        smoother, normally used in the following way:
            - CPU issues draw commands to one
            - The GPU renders another one
            - The presentation engine displays it
    - 3+
        rare but often used in VR systems for high frame-rate targets
